##### 12/18/23 Learning GDevelop

### Introduction
 The freedom project is a long year project where you make anything of your choice. For this year's freedom project I decided to choose GDevelop as my tool. In my previous blog I talked about how I looked at the GDevelop documentation and started messing around with some of the behaviors/expressions. In this blog I'll go more in depth about how I started trying to make something that I actually want included into my game.

### GDevelop
 In GDevelop I went through the documentaion specifically looking for something that would help me get the interactive part of the game that I want to create. In animal crossing you sort of have to interact with the other characters to know what to do. The characters have little speech bubbles that have text appaear as they speak and you can either click on it to skip to the end of what they're saying or yoy can wait until they're done talking. As I was looking through the `text` and `speech` documentation I found `auto typing animation for text "typewriter" effect`. I added the autoptyping behavior to text. Before the text is displayed I inserted the text that I wanted printed out. When the text is being printed out it looks like it's being typed out as it's printed out. I chose the `text_autoTyping` and made the interval between characters in seconds, 0.05. The lower the number is the faster it's printed out and the higher the number is the slower it's printed out. Now I need to make it so that it doesn't appear throughput the whole game.
