https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/objects/text/#font-and-text-style is what I used to look at how and properly work the `auto typing animation for text "typewriter" effect` because in the previous blog I talked about how much of a struggle it was to make it actually work the way I wanted it to. From the documentation I didn't really get anything helpful or sort of aiming to what I was looking for. It was more so how to add effects to the text itself and make it look for appealing.

Since the website did not work I went on Youtube and looked for videos about hwo to use the `auto typing animitaion for text "typewriter" effect` and found one that matched exactly what I was looking for. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgLMq61Nnmw This video showed some examples of whete dialogue has been seen in certain games. Basically, in order to be able to make the dialougue happen we have to download a `Dialogue tree extension`. The dialogue tree extension does exactly what most interactive games like animal crossing do.
