### Introduction
 The freedom project is a long year project where you make anything of your choice. For this year's freedom project I decided to choose GDevelop as my tool. In my previous blog I talked about how I looked at the GDevelop documentation and started messing around with some of the behaviors/expressions. In this blog I'll talk about how I looked more at the GDevelop documentation and some youtube videos to be a little more helpful and see some of the assets in action.

 ### GDevelop Documentation/Videos
https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/objects/text/#font-and-text-style is what I used to look at how and properly work the `auto typing animation for text "typewriter" effect` because in the previous blog I talked about how much of a struggle it was to make it actually work the way I wanted it to. From the documentation I didn't really get anything helpful or sort of aiming to what I was looking for. It was more so how to add effects to the text itself and make it look for appealing.

Since the website did not work I went on Youtube and looked for videos about hwo to use the `auto typing animitaion for text "typewriter" effect` and found one that matched exactly what I was looking for. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgLMq61Nnmw This video showed some examples of whete dialogue has been seen in certain games. Basically, in order to be able to make the dialougue happen we have to download a `Dialogue tree extension`. The dialogue tree extension does exactly what most interactive games like animal crossing do. In order to make this happen a new even sheet has to be created so that a new event condition could be added and from there the new dialogue tree extension will be used. In the extension there is a json file where when you open it you can start adding your dialogue and then this is where all the conditions and expressions are added. This makes everything a lot simpler because since I already know what expressions and conditons to use from what I found in the previous blogs therefore, this helps because all I needed to know was where to add these expressions into and now I know. Downloading this extension really ties everything together.

### EDP
I am currently on step 3 and 4 of the engineering design process as I am still collecting more information to figure out how to make my game the way I want it to. However since I have now figured out how to include the `typewriter effect` into my game I will now start looking more into the basics to be able to create a simple working game.

### Skills
While reading through the GDevelop documentaion I learned how to read, reading documentaion isn't easy because the information isn't always found so easily. I've also learned how to google because I had to google videos for how to use certain assets from GDevelop. But also I've google certain objects from GDevelop because it's a lot easier tham looking for it on the documentaions since there's so much.

### Next Steps
In my previous blog I talked about how my next steps were to incorporate expressions into ,y objects to make the object work the way I want it to, however, since I got so intrested in how to actually make the `typewriter effect` work thats all I've been really researching and now that I know that one of my biggest step is to download an extenstion then thats what I have done. But I also plan on learning more about the basics and just being able to know how to create a simple functioning game. However, now that i have figure out what I wanted to learn about the most I can head on to learning about something different now.
