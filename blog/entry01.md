    Tool & Project: The freedom project is a long year project where you make anything of your choice. For this year's freedom project I decided to choose GDevelop as my tool. Using GDevelop I want to make an interactive game similar to Animal Crossing. In animal crossing you get to interact with the other charcaters in the game. While also being able to just roam around your island and sort of do mini-tasks. For my game I want to make th eplayer be able to interact with the other characters for hints or for directions or to even allow the players to sort of have a say in the game. I'm still deciding if I want to make a game where the player has to complete a bunch of tasks or if I want to make a game where they have to complete one taks per level in order to move on to the next. However, I also like the idea of making a game like mario but with a game like mario, the player interacting with the characters wouldn't really make sense. As of now I want to make a game where the player has to complete one tasks per leve in order to move on to the next.
