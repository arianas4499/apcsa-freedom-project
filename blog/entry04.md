### Introduction
As we are approaching the expo, we are now starting to actually get more into desiging our project. I am now currently deciding what I would like my project to look like and mapping out the basics. For now I am planning on just starting with two basic levels because just doing one would be too little but two is just enough. If I have more time I will continue to do more levels. Right now, my main focus is to get the basics down first to geta minimal functioning game. I started "designing" my game on paper.

#### Level 1:
 I want my level 1 to consist of multiple characters because I want the main character to interat with the other characters in the game in order to continue on with the level. This level will also consist of obstacles meaning that I will include enemies that will prevent the player from moving on to the next level. As well, as some difficult obstacles that are't so easy to get over (these small details will be dealt with during the beyond MVP).

###### Characters
So far with level 1 there has already been a lot of difficulty.  Adding a character was one of the difficult things to do because I didn't want to use one of the characters already given on the website, I wanted to choose a different one. There's a website where you can download sprite sheets and use them in your game. After finding one that I liked I went to go add it but every time I tried to add it, it just appeared as a long picture. I went on youtube and looked up how to add a character in GDevelop: https://youtu.be/V0d93eILHkQ?si=B05HtZN1ajsgO-HT
I didn't find one speficically for how to add a character but this video went in depth on how to create a game. This however, still didn't help as much. I went on google to search up how to add a character on gdevelop with sprite sheets and I found this: https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/tutorials/piskel-sprite-sheets/#import-the-sprite-sheet
This website was SUPER helpful because everything made sense. Unfortunately, the first sprite sheet wasn't evenely spread out, therefore it wasn't so easy to cut them so that they align perfectly. However, after looking for a second sprite sheet I found one that I liked and that one was aligned perfectly and I was able to add it onto a game.

Adding a background was also really difficult. In the beginning when I was first starting to learn about gdevelop I said that adding a background was the easiset thing to do because at the time it really looked simple. However, when you're starting off from scratch it is a slightly more difficult because it has nothing, no behaviors, animations, nothing. At first when I was adding the background it would show multiple picture of the background as the background like this:

I didn't know how to fix it and when I searched it up on the documentaion it was more confusing so I searched it up on youtube: https://youtu.be/ACUkesLB62U?si=vBSqgE09ZfX4R6YK

This video helped so much because it showed step by step on how to add the background so as I followed along with the tutorial I was able to add my background.
#### Level 2:
Level 2 is soemthing that I will continue to work on. I'm still trying to figure out how to be able to add enemies and make my character be able to die so level 2 is a work in progress but as long as level 1 is fully done, level 2 won't be as difficult.


### EDP
I am currently on step 4, 5 and 6 of the engineering design process. I am on step 4 because I still had to map out/ plan out what I wanted these two currrent levels to look like, however, the main focus was to start creating my vision. This is where step 5 and 6 of the engineering design process come in, I am creating my game while also testing it out to see if the game actually works. Even if the game isn't exactly how I envisioned it, it should at least be able to do the baiscs. Therefore, creating the basics of the game was the main golal during this blog.

### Skills
One of the skills that I have yet to be able to master is being able to master my time wisely. The freedom project is mainly done outside of school and is on our own free time. There are some days where we have time in class but for majority of the time it's at home. But since it isn't being checked everyday then procrasinating becomes even easier. As well as googling was one of the biggest skills that I've developed because googling for help has really helped a lot.

### What's next?:
My next step for the freedom project is to add a timer for the player to make it more interesting. As well as adding a text box so that the text can be displayed and hopefully make it so that it is moving along with the character and can be skipped. These are basically the last things for the mvp so if it does not take up to much time then I can start working beyond mvp and make it work even smoother. Also, to work on level 2 and I think I want to change the background because it looks kind of blurry and not so clear.
