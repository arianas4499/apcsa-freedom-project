### Introduction
As we are approaching the expo, we are now starting to actually get more into desiging our project. I am now currently deciding what I would like my project to look like and mapping out the basics. For now I am planning on just starting with two basic levels because just doing one would be too little but two is just enough. If I have more time I will continue to do more levels. Right now, my main focus is to get the basics down first to get a niminal fucntioning game. I started "desiging" my game on paper. I want the first level to look like this:

#### Level 1:
As you can see my level 1 will consist of multiple characters because I want the main character to inteact with the other characters in the game in order to continue on with the level. This level will also consist of obstacles meaning that I will include enemies that will prevent the player from moving on to the next level. As well, as some difficult obstacles that are't so easy to get over (these small details will be dealt with during th beyond MVP).


#### Level 2:
Level 2 is very similar to level 1 except difficulty will be different on each level.


### EDP
I am currently on step 4, 5 and 6 of the engineering design process. I am on step 4 because I still had to map out/ plan out what I wanted these two currrent levels to look like, however, the main focus was to start creating my vision. This is where step 5 and 6 of the engineering design process come in, I am creating my game while also testing it out to see if the game actually works. Even if the game isn't exactly how i envision it, it should at least be able to do the baiscs. Therefore, creating the basics of the game was the main golal during this blog.
